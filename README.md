# Mybioinformatics
Aggregation of the codes in the period of self-pacing the bioinformatics and data analysis

During the December 2022 and February 2023, I firstly graduated from the bachelor of Science degree of the University of Melbourne, a spectacular adventure over the 3 years. I decided to dig deeper into the field of biosciences, thus I registered a programme ran by ex-BGI bioinformatician Mr. WANG, talking about RNAseq and genomics, and also, this programme could help me to finish the previously failed objective in my old legion computer, due to some small problems in ubuntu and virtual box. 

Meanwhile, I would like to share some of my built programs in this repository, working as a record over this period of time.
